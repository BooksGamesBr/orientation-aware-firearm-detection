# Orientation Aware Object Detection with Applications to Firearms

Automatic detection of firearms is important for enhancing security and safety of people, however, it is a challenging task owing to the wide variations in shape, size and appearance of firearms. Viewing angle variations and occlusions by the weaponâ€™s carrier and the surrounding people, further increases the difficulty of the task. Moreover, the existing object detectors process rectangular areas, though a thin and long rifle may actually cover only a small percentage of that area and the rest may contain irrelevant details suppressing the required object signatures. To handle these challenges we propose an Orientation Aware Object Detector (OAOD) which has achieved improved firearm detection and localization performance.
